# Hello GitHub!

### This should have been done a long time ago.
Hopefully my grade doesn't suffer too much..

I find myself stressed by the bookclub project, either its just myself overcomplicating things or I underestimated how something like it would work.

Probably both. But I am definitely overreaching with my capabilities at the moment.

Doesn't help with how many ideas fly through my head when working on the project.
