# Hello GitHub!

### This should have been done a long time ago.
Hopefully my grade doesn't suffer too much..

I find myself stressed by the bookclub project, either its just myself overcomplicating things or I underestimated how something like it would work.

Probably both. But I am definitely overreaching with my capabilities at the moment.

Doesn't help with how many ideas fly through my head when working on the project.

Definitely overengineering this thing for what it worth, I should really get in the habit of making something that works before trying to optimize it.
I've been stressing over making a generic bases for things.
Also considering we we're gonna have Accounts, Books, Reviews, and somehow a discussions section.

I've been nothing but unproductive.
